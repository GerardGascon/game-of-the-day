            <p>To submit your game to the website you first have to go to the
                <a href="https://github.com/GerardGascon/game-of-the-day/issues" target="_blank">Issues Page</a>
                and submit a new issue following the <b>Game Submission Template</b>.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Issue Form for submitting your game.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Write your game's title and link to the download page, remember that your link must have the <b>https://</b>
                prefix in order to work properly.
            </p>
            <p>Then add the store page's name where it is available. It can be itch.io, Steam, Game Jolt, or anything else,
                this is used for telling where it's hosted inside the website.
            </p>
            <p>Drag and drop your cover image inside the Cover Image field. <b>DO NOT</b> write anything else in there
                or the issue might not get parsed correctly.
            </p>

                <figcaption>How it looks when uploading it.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/page/tutorial-3.png" alt="Cover image field preview mode"/>
                <figcaption>How it looks when previewing it.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Write a short description of your game, it should not surpass the 120-character limit.</p>
            <p>This limitation is not strictly applied but if your description is way beyond that limit, it may be rejected.</p>
            <p>After that, add your screenshots the same way you added your cover image, remember that your game can have
                <b>up to 3 screenshots</b>, if you have more than 3, your submission will be rejected.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, you'll have to add the developers that participated in the development of the game, as well as
                their social network link (or whatever link that references them).
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/page/tutorial-4.png" alt="Developers field"/>
                <figcaption>Pay attention to the format.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p><b>Important</b>: Please pay attention how this field is written.</p>
            <p>If the developer has socials, you should write their name as so: <code>Name - Link</code></p>
            <p>If they don't have socials, you should write just their name as so: <code>Name</code></p>
            <p>Note: Even though the screenshots don't show it, the developers' names can have spaces if you need to.</p>

            <h2>Revision</h2>

            <p>After you submit your game, an action will be automatically triggered and if everything is correct I'll
                receive an email telling me to review your submission.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Submission process.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And if everything is correct, I'll add your game to the website, and it will be ready to be showcased on a random game that nobody knows!</p>
